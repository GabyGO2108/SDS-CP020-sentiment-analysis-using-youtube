UgxCKVBr5EV9zV4nIBZ4AaABAg,Spotify recommendations are so awful it truly boggles the mind.

"Ugxc1EJteBpop2kz4P94AaABAg,""Even though the Spotify algorithm gets a lot of hype for being super advanced, a ton of folks on those big forum sites where music is discussed seem to think it's a total letdown. According to them, Spotify's algorithm just sucks. But guess what? They've found a real gem that beats it hands down: YouTube Music. Apparently, YouTube Music's algorithm works like pure magic and blows Spotify out of the water. It's way, way, way better, no contest. So, like, nowadays Spotify is all about getting people to talk about their algorithm and how amazing it is. They even pay folks to do it, which is basically a big advertisement for the company. But let's get real, when it comes to actually listening to music, the fancier their algorithm gets, the less likely it is to play songs you actually enjoy. It ends up being more repetitive and you find yourself skipping through more and more songs most of the time. It's like, what's the deal with that."",@Jayromee";;

"Ugwb7yxyBeP0A2VBK1N4AaABAg,""Spotify and most other streaming platforms don't have a profitable business model that can pay the musician for a living so screw all that. Just a fancier version of old Napster and other piracy sites which didn't pay either, and new musicians would upload their music to piracy sites because they wanted traction, the same way they do on streaming nowadays, with no monetary return. Only the large labels can survive on streaming, not because of the streaming revenue, which there is none, but because they are large shareholders and the stock price keeps rising. Basically a pyramid scheme. I'll be really happy to see the day when it explodes, as such internet balloons did in the late 90's after a period of superficial stock price rise."",@kdakan";;
